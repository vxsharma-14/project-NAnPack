def TridiagonalSolver(tMax, A, B, C, D, UU):
    """Solve a tridiagonal matrix for a system of linear equations.

    The function is used by implicit methods for the obtaining the
    numerical solution of PDEs. The approach to solve
    such a system is given in Appendix B of CFD Vol. 1 by Klaus Hoffmann.

    The formulation for the implicit methods is of the form:

    A(i,n)U(i-1,n+1) + B(i,n)U(i,n+1) + C(i,n)U(i+1,n+1) = D(i,n)

    Call signature:
        TridiagonalSolver(tMax, A, B, C, D, UU)

    Parameters
    ----------
    tMax: int
        Grid points in a given axis direction.
    A: ndarray[float], =1d
        Coefficient of u(i-1, n+1) in the implicit formulation.
    B: ndarray[float], =1d
        Coefficient of u(i, n+1) in the implicit formulation.
    C: ndarray[float], =1d
        Coefficient of u(i+1, n+1) in the implicit formulation.
    D: ndarray[float], =1d
        Right-hand side equations in the implicit formulation.
    UU: ndarray[float], =1d
        The dependent variable at time level, n
        along a given axis as required by the implicit method.

    Returns
    -------
    UU: ndarray[float], =1d
        The dependent variable at time level, n+1 within the entire domain
        calculated using equation (B-5) in CFD Vol.1 by Klaus Hoffmann.
