# DIFFUS
## A Differential eqUations Solvers repository.

A package of numerical solvers based on finite-difference methods for one-dimensional and two-dimensional parabolic, elliptic, hyperbolic and mixed partial differential equations written in Python language and inteded for use in teaching and academic research.

Thank you for visiting this page. I hope that together we will make DIFFUS a great tool for all learners and researchers alike.
